research_interests:
  - title: Vision Language Model
    description: Medicine frequently presents challenges that are inherently multi-modal, requiring both textual and visual understanding. My research in Vision Language Modeling seeks to enhance the AI's capability to interpret and act upon complex medical scenarios presented through images and textual prompts. Beyond this, I'm delving into building clinician trust in AI through transparent and reliable model behaviors.
  - title: AI-based Diagnosis and Discovery
    description: With the increasing complexities in medical diagnostics, I'm investigating the potential of AI to match or even surpass clinician accuracy in certain diagnostic tasks. My recent endeavors have led to the development of advanced tools tailored for leukemia detection and diagnosis, offering promising avenues for rapid and accurate disease identification.
  - title: Synthetic Data & Generative AI
    description: Facing both scarcity and privacy concerns in medical data, I view synthetic data as a transformative solution. Yet, its true potential is unlocked only when meeting clinical standards. I've pioneered human-in-the-loop techniques to achieve this, and I'm enthusiastic about pushing boundaries in this domain further.
  - title: Self Supervised Learning in Medical Imagery
    description: The intricacies and sparse annotations of medical imaging demand an approach beyond traditional supervised techniques. Venturing into self-supervised learning, I'm delving into the potential of discerning complex patterns in the absence of annotations. My interest lies in developing robust representation learning techniques, which can serve as a foundational bedrock when bridging image modality with other modalities such as clinical notes, electronic health records, genomic sequences, and wearable device data.

üöÄ Hello there! Welcome to my page! I'm currently diving deep into the exciting world of Computational Medicine at both UC San Francisco and UC Berkeley, guided by the [Atul Butte, MD, PhD](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/atul.butte) and [Ahmed Alaa, PhD](https://ahmedmalaa.github.io/)! üåü I also have the immense pleasure of working closely with the [Gregory Goldgof, MD, PhD](https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/doctors/gregory-goldgof) and [Iain Carmichael, PhD](https://idc9.github.io/). Each of these esteemed faculty members brings a unique perspective, blending cutting-edge AI techniques with deep insights from clinical sciences. Their individual expertise enriches my academic journey, making every project a new learning adventure.

I'm on a thrilling journey at the crossroads of biomedical research and artificial intelligence, all with the goal of realizing the dream of precision medicine. I've had the fantastic opportunity to craft and employ machine learning and deep learning strategies on vast biological and clinical datasets, ranging from vibrant biomedical images to intricate clinical notes and the vast expanse of genomic data. üéâ

Oh, and by the way, I absolutely adore the Japanese manga ["One Piece"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece)! üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Every new project I embark on feels like setting sail to a new island full of adventure. Just as the Straw Hat crew faces their challenges head-on, with honor and integrity, I approach each challenging project fearlessly, yet with care and bubbling excitement. Ready to explore and conquer new horizons, just like Luffy and his crew!
