I am a 4th year Ph.D. Candidate Biomedical Informatics advised  at UC San Francisco and UC Berkeley advised by
[Atul J. Butte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atul_Butte) and [Ahmed M. Alaa](https://ahmedmalaa.github.io). I have a keen passion for computational pathology, actively collaborating with clinical experts to develop and implement cutting-edge deep learning algorithms for the diagnosis and characterization of hematology malignancies. Additionally, I am intrigued by the field of synthetic data generation, which allows me to create realistic data for various applications. Furthermore, I possess experience in working with clinical notes and genomic data. 

Outside of my professional pursuits, I find enjoyment in indulging in Japanese Manga, with [One Piece](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece) being my favorite.
