üöÄ Hello there! I'm currently diving deep into the exciting world of Computational Medicine at both UC San Francisco and UC Berkeley, guided by the Dr. [Atul Butte, MD, PhD](https://profiles.ucsf.edu/atul.butte) and Dr. [Ahmed Alaa, PhD](https://ahmedmalaa.github.io/)! üåü I also have the immense pleasure of working closely with the Dr. [Gregory Goldgof, MD, PhD](https://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/doctors/gregory-goldgof) and Dr. [Iain Carmichael, PhD](https://idc9.github.io/). Each of these esteemed faculty members brings a unique perspective, blending cutting-edge AI techniques with deep insights from clinical sciences. Their individual expertise enriches my academic journey, making every project a new learning adventure.

I'm on a thrilling journey at the crossroads of biomedical research and artificial intelligence, all with the goal of realizing the dream of precision medicine. I've had the fantastic opportunity to craft and employ machine learning and deep learning strategies on vast biological and clinical datasets, ranging from vibrant biomedical images to intricate clinical notes and the vast expanse of genomic data. üéâ

Collaboration is the name of the game! I've been at the helm of multiple projects, leading some and collaborating on others, all while ensuring we're pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

Oh, and by the way, I absolutely adore the Japanese manga ["One Piece"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_Piece)! üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Every new project I embark on feels like setting sail to a new island full of adventure. Just as the Straw Hat crew faces their challenges head-on, with honor and integrity, I approach each challenging project fearlessly, yet with care and bubbling excitement. Ready to explore and conquer new horizons, just like Luffy and his crew!


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
